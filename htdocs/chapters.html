            In a world where strength and compassion go hand in hand,
            Rhea takes her dedication a step further where she recognizes the essential needs of domestic abuse
            shelters and the individuals they serve. With a deep understanding of sustainability,
            she has created hygiene kits for these shelters, incorporating eco-friendly and reusable products.
        </p>

        <img src="/assets/img/chapters/pic1chapters.jpg" class=" py-3" width="60%" height="60%">

        <p>
            Rhea has used the Safe&Aware platform to actively
            campaign to businesses and secured more than $15,000
            to pack basic sanitation kits for the shelters.

            <br>
            <br>

            Safe&Aware became a verified partner through Amazon's I-GIVE program and secured corporate
            funding in partnership with the Clean the World Foundation.
            Rhea assembled 150 sustainable hygiene kits  for over 300 domestic violence
            survivors with the help of 150 volunteers. These sustainability hygiene kits
            have served as a symbol for growth and healing and have helped survivors embark
            on their journey towards a brighter future.

            Rhea has doubled the number of kits she has assembled and is working to distribute them to the
            International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care to support over 600 victims both in the
            United States and internationally.

    <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3">
        <p>
            Kevin Nall, an Economics and Mathematics major studying at the
            University of York, is making waves at Orpington as he spearheads the launch of the UK chapter of Safe&Aware.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kevin is partnering with the Orpington Police Station to develop a comprehensive training program
            for local law enforcement officers. This program aims to enhance their understanding of domestic
            violence cases and improve their response strategies. He's also working closely with the Bromley Domestic
            Abuse Services, which covers the Orpington area, to ensure that Safe&Aware's efforts complement existing support systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kevin’s goal is to create a network of supportive employers willing to offer job opportunities
            to domestic violence survivors.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Orpington as its launchpad, Safe&Aware UK is poised to make a significant impact in the fight
            against domestic violence, offering hope and practical solutions to those affected by this pervasive issue
            in communities across the United Kingdom.

        <ol type="1">
            <h4>Comprehensive Family Planning Resources</h4>
            <p> Recognizing the importance of reproductive autonomy for survivors, Gupta  has developed a
                network of family planning resources:</p>
            <li>
                <div class="my-1"><i>Medical Partnerships</i></div>
                Collaborating with gynecologists and women's health clinics in Chennai to

            <li>
                <div class="my-1"><i>Education Sessions</i></div>
                Organizing workshops on various contraception methods, sexual health, and reproductive rights,
                often conducted in Tamil to ensure accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="my-1"><i>Counseling Services</i></div>
                Offering confidential counseling with trained professionals to discuss family planning options,
                addressing the specific concerns of domestic violence survivors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="my-1"><i>Child Care Support</i></div>
                Connecting survivors with affordable child care options, enabling them to pursue employment or
                educational opportunities.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>By integrating these employment and family planning resources into Safe&Aware's services,
            Gupta aims to provide a holistic support system that addresses the immediate needs of survivors
            while also empowering them to build independent, self-determined futures.</p>
