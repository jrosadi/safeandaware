            In a world where strength and compassion go hand in hand,
            Rhea takes her dedication a step further where she recognizes the essential needs of domestic abuse
            shelters and the individuals they serve. With a deep understanding of sustainability,
            she has created hygiene kits for these shelters, incorporating eco-friendly and reusable products.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rhea has used the Safe&Aware platform to actively campaign to businesses and secured more than $6000+
            to pack basic sanitation kits for the shelters.

            <br>
            <br>

            Safe&Aware became a verified partner through Amazon's I-GIVE program and secured corporate funding
            in partnership with the Clean the World Foundation.
            Rhea assembled 150 sustainable hygiene kits, totaling over $6000, for survivors at Sarah's Inn
            and Mujeres Latinas en Acción with the help of 30 volunteers.
            These sustainability hygiene kits have served as a symbol for growth and healing and
            have helped survivors embark on their journey towards a brighter future.

        <p>
            Rhea has doubled the number of kits she has assembled and is working to distribute them to the
            International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care to support over 600 victims both in the
            United States and internationally.

            She is actively fostering partnerships with local businesses, organizations,
            and the community to gather more resources and support for their cause.
            By involving others in their mission, she has expanded Safe&Aware’s reach,
            making a difference in the lives of countless individuals.

        <p>
            As part of Safe&Aware’s mission of helping individuals feel safe, respected, and valued,
            Nadia Rosadi has looked for ways Safe&Aware can support those in need in the local community.
            For the past 2 years, Nadia has spearheaded efforts involving community members.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nadia has led initiatives involving community members, including annual food drives,
            where they contribute non-perishable items.
            Nadia especially focuses on raising youths’ awareness of local issues and encouraging their
            participation in Safe&Aware’s projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            This year, Nadia has helped Safe&Aware raise and donate about $500 worth in non-perishable items so far.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nadia has also encouraged Safe&Aware collaborations
            with local martial arts businesses, where Safe&Aware has hosted several seminars.
