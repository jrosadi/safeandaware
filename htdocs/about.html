        <p class="text-center fs-4" style="color:white">Safe&Aware is a non-profit organization to teach safety, self-defense, and confidence to women and youth.
            We have reached out to many communities and domestic abuse shelters to educate and support victims in addition
            to organizing events in Chicago and its suburbs to raise awareness about
            the importance of self-defense and how it can protect people from potential threats.

                <p class="card-text">Hello! My name is Rhea Makkuni, and I’m a junior at Walter Payton College Preparatory.
                    When I was young, during a trip to India I saw the impact of domestic violence on individuals and families,
                    and the pain, suffering, and long-term consequences it brings.
                    The trauma, fear, and isolation experienced during an abusive relationship can have a lasting impact on an
                    individual's mental well-being and also on their children.
                    To provide relief to the immense suffering and emotional distress survivors go through,
                    I hope to provide them with the necessary support and resources to heal and recover.

                <p class="card-text">Hi, I’m Nadia Rosadi, a current student of William Fremd High School in Palatine.
                    I have been practicing Taekwondo since 2012 and currently hold a black belt in the martial art.
                    Using what I have learned to teach my community about safety and self-defense,
                    I strive to help individuals, especially women and youths, build confidence.
                    When I have time, I enjoy teaching fellow taekwondo students, playing the violin, and watching k/c-dramas.
