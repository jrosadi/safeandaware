            <p>A trend of youth gun violence has been seen this summer in Chicago, with at least 57 ages 19 and under being shot.
                More than half of Chicago residents will witness a shooting by 40, with the average age to witness a shooting being
                just 14 years old, according to a new study by the Journal of the American Medical Association.

                Emma Sutanto, a high school freshman, recently attended a Safe&Aware class at Mary Bartelme Park.

            <p>
                "Just a week ago, a young man got shot right in this neighborhood– the thing is, this violence has become
                so common you kinda just brush it off. When I saw Safe&Aware's flyer, it dawned on me that I could be the
                next person, and I started feeling unsafe in my own community."

            </p>

            <p>
                As part of their community safety education program, Safe&Aware discusses topics such as active shooter
                awareness. Additionally, the non-profit educates youth on what to do if they witness unsafe activities,
                as well as how to safely dispose of firearms.

            </p>

            <p>
                “Maybe some ten, twenty years ago, kids didn’t really have to worry about this, but now these issues have
                become something I'm constantly worried and thinking about. Safe&Aware's class has offered a lot of great
                support and guidance on how to deal with these dangerous situations," Sutanto said.

            </p>

            <p>
                Safe&Aware's founders, Rhea Makkuni and Nadia Rosadi, aim to empower youths and encourage an optimistic
                outlook through teaching them self-defense skills. By calling attention to the voices of youths, the
                organization hopes to bring real, lasting change.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Violence is on the rise in Chicago. While the youth have been promised that the root of crime will be
                eradicated through mental health resources or affordable housing, ultimately, taking our own initiatives
                is vital to change," Rosadi stated. "Immediate action is needed, and as youth citizens of Chicago, we
                have a duty to ourselves and our future,” Makkuni added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with expanding its workshops throughout Chicago, Safe&Aware is developing an online violence
                prevention resource library that will be accessible to the public. For more information on Safe&Aware,
